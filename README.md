# Lazysh source gen

Sort of source generator test to try to achieve this:

See [this](Usage/Program.cs) for example.

# Ideas

* Implement generic factory class for this kind of interface implementations.
* Try to be more implicit by allowing users avoid specifying `Lazysh` attribute on every interface(maybe just use what generic parameters are passed to Lazy).
